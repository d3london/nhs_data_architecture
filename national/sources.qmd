_Early preview v0.1_

This page contains an overview of different types of source software system, or modules within systems, where a patient may have data generated and recorded across their healthcare journey. These are not descriptions of exact systems that exist in different locations, but rather a **general classification based on the different types of data that are generated.**

### Patient administration

#### Patient administration systems (PAS)
Software that capture non-clinical information about patients, and their activity across different care settings (including all hospitals). Information captured includes identities, demographics, and address, and also captures pathway information such as referrals, waiting lists and appointments, as well as inpatient activity and ward movements or discharge. PAS may be standalone software solutions offered by different suppliers, or may be integrated as a function into Electronic Health Records (EHR) software. PAS also serves as a master patient index for other records in the care location. PAS are joined directly to the national [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service), which is a live, national directory of non-clinical information for patients that is part of the NHS Spine.

### Primary care

#### Patient demographic record
Much like PAS systems, these are parts of a GP Electronic Health Record (EHR) software that maintain a record of non-clinical information for patients, including their GP registration history. Patient details across different GP systems are coordinated through a [Primary Care Registration Management service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/primary-care-registration-management) and also synced with the [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service). Data may be stored in structured tables containing patient identify, demographic, address, and registration information.

#### Structured (coded) clinical record
When patients see a clinician, or undergo procedures and tests, or experience medical diagnoses, symptoms, and events, these data are entered into the record as 'clinical codes'. Coding is performed manually, largely by GPs during or following consultations, or after reviewing letters and results. There are hundreds of thousands of codes that each represent unique clinical concepts, and large vocabularies or dictionaries that define these. The most commonly used for primary care in the NHS is [SNOMED CT](https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/digital-primary-care/snomed-ct/). Codes are typically stored in tables. A simple example of part of such a table is below:

| PATIENT_ID | DATE     | CONCEPT_NAME                                    | CONCEPT_CODE    |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 123456789  | 2020-1-1 | Pre-diabetes (disorder)                         | 858301000000107 |
| 123456789  | 2021-1-1 | Diabetes mellitus type 2 (disorder)             | 44054006        |
| 123456789  | 2024-1-1 | Retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus (disorder) | 4855003         |

#### Lab tests and other measurements
Results from tests and other measurements can be entered into the record by clinicians, and are usually stored as separate tables that also capture result values and outcomes. In many cases, where tests originated in primary care and where there is interoperability between pathology services and the EHR, these values are automatically sent into the system once results are ready.

#### Medications and prescribing data
When a prescription for a medication is generated, either one off or as a repeat prescription, this information is recorded in the GP EHR. This information is directly used to [send prescriptions](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service) to a dispenser (like a local pharmacy), as well as populating the patient's [Summary Care Record](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr) with their current medications. The GP EHR also contains records of requests - such as when a patient asks for a prescription to be renewed. 

#### Unstructured (free text) clinical record
While GPs make effort to code important information about their patients, a large amount of additional information is found in the unstructured, or free text, record. This simply includes blocks of text that are written to describe encounters and other interactions. As part of the medicolegal record, such text typically contains patients' descriptions of their medical history, symptoms, and other experiences, as well as examination findings and clinical thought process. Free text data is not readily accessible for analysis, and may also contain idenfitiable information. 

#### Referrals data
Primary care referrals to other services are increasingly centralised through the national [e-Referral service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service), and provide an electronic source of referral data. Some referral pathways remain paper based. Statistical reporting is supported through aggregation of [referral and waiting list data](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/) by referral centres such as hospitals.

#### Community pharmacy
Most prescriptions are dispensed to patients through designated local pharmacies. [While the electronic prescription service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service) produces an electronic record of prescribed items that can be used for reimbursements, some prescription and dispensing activity are still conducted through paper based records. 

### Civil registries

#### Births and deaths
Births and deaths are reported through established systems of forms and submissions to the level of registration districts. Records here are collated upwards to the General Register Office who hold national records for births and deaths, as well as marriages and civil partnerships.

### Secondary / tertiary care
<img src="sources/secondarycare.jpg" alt="Primary care" title="" height="50" /> 

#### Structured (coded) clinical record
Data that is coded at point of care is less common in secondary care when compared to primary care, but some Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems such as Epic enable the entry of standard codes such as SNOMED CT into a patient's record. More commonly, data may be "semi-structured" through forms or flowsheets, where records are made with specific fields (such as "medical history", "recorded symptoms", and "examination findings").

#### Unstructured (free text) record / reports
The vast majority of patient data in secondary care is found as free text. This includes narrative that records the details of encounters between clinicians and patients (from admission to ward rounds and discharge), as well as records of procedures and operations, nursing and allied health professinoal notes, and clinical thought processes (for example from a multi-disciplinary meeting). This also includes discharge summaries, clinical letters, and longer reports of investigations such as imaging or pathology. 

#### Lab tests and other measurements
Similar to primary care, secondary care settings capture laboratory test results and other clinical measurements. Lab results are often stored in dedicated Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) which interface with the main hospital information system. Results are typically stored in structured formats, allowing for viewing trends  and for automated alerting of abnormal results.

#### Secondary care medication and dispensing data
Hospital pharmacies use electronic systems to manage general medication orders and dispensing, for inpatient and outpatient episodes. For inpatients, electronic medication charts are used by clinicians for viewing and recording prescriptions, timings, and administration. The data underlying these systems can be used to show what medications and dosages were prescribed, dispensed, and administered. These systems are often part of or interfaced with the main Electronic Health Record (EHR). They may also integrate decision support features for drug interactions and dosing.

#### Radiology / DICOM
Radiology departments use Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to store and manage medical imaging studies. These systems store images in the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format, along with associated metadata. Radiologists' reports are typically stored in a Radiology Information System (RIS), which is often integrated with the PACS and the main hospital EHR.

#### Histopathology slides
Digital pathology systems are increasingly used to capture, store, and analyze high-resolution images of histopathology slides. These systems allow for remote viewing, automated image analysis, and integration with other clinical data sources. The associated pathology reports are typically stored in structured formats within the Laboratory Information System.

#### Medical device outputs
Numnerous types of modern medical devices, ranging from electrocardiogram machines to ventilators, infusion pumps, and monitoring equipment, often have the capability to output data directly into information systems. Some signals data may be stored in time-series databases (for example - heart rate change every minute). Other device outputs may be stored as scanned images.

#### Genomic testing reports
While raw sequencing data is generated in genomics testing labs, these data are not typically available for analysis or clinical use. Instead, reports of gene panels, or reports of specific genetic mutations or biomarkers, are passed to hospitals and stored as unstructured or semi-structured reports (e.g. in .pdf format).

#### Cancer data
Data generated during cancer care is usually held across multiple systems. These include prescribing systems for chemotherapy, as well as records of multi-disciplinary team (MDT) notes, typically unstructured. Other cancer data is found in different free text reports, including from histopathology, and from radiology. 

### Specialist testing services

#### Molecular diagnostic laboratory networks  
Genomic testing in the NHS is provided through a national testing network. Specifically, the testing for mutations within tumours (somatic molecular testing) is handled by a network of molecular diagnostic laboratories. The direct results from these tests (e.g. sequencing data) are held locally and not directly available for research or analysis use-cases. However, data are passed back to hospitals as reports.
