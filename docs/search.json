    "text": "Early preview v0.1\nThis page contains an overview of the broad classifications of data flow from the main schematic. At present, there is clear division in architecture that supports direct care (top half of schematic) and architecture that supports other secondary uses (bottom half of schematic).\n\nDirect care\n\nNHS Spine\n\nThe NHS Spine pulls in core clinical data from various NHS systems, including GP practices, hospitals, and other care settings, to provide a national source of truth for the most vital patient information. Components include:\n\nPersonal Demographics Service (PDS), serving as a central, authoritative source of patient demographic information with each patient identified through an NHS number. Patient records can be updated through primary and secondary care software, and it serves as a master patient index for other digital systems or for analytics.\n\nSummary Care Record (SCR), containing key clinical information such as allergies, medications, and adverse reactions. This data is sourced primarily from GP systems and is used to support direct patient care across different NHS settings, ensuring that essential information is always available to clinicians when needed.\nElectronic Prescription Service allows prescriptions from primary, community, and hospitals to be sent to pharmacies that dispense medications.\n\n\n\nShared care records\n\nShared Care Records (or Health Information Exchange (HIE)) integrates patient data from multiple care settings within a local health and care system. Data is typically shared from GP practices, hospitals, community services, mental health providers, and social care. This can include demographic information, diagnoses, medications, care plans, and recent encounters. The purpose is to provide a more comprehensive view of a patient’s health and care history to support care delivery occurring across multiple physical locations. A fuller view of how Shared Care Records have evolved in the NHS can be found here.\n\n\nNHS App\n\nThe NHS App serves as a patient-facing portal that both various types of data, and provides services directly to patients. It interfaces with GP systems to allow patients to book appointments and order repeat prescriptions. It also pulls in data from GP systems and the NHS Spine to enable patients to view their medical records. Additionally, it may integrate with referral systems to enable patients to view their hospital referral and appointment statuses, and average waiting times.\n\n\n\nOther secondary uses\n\nGP data (NHS and other) extractions\n\nPrimary care systems in the NHS (EMIS, TPP, Vision) offer an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows interface with the clinical system, and bulk extraction of patient data. This enables the onwards flow of most data tables within the source systems, including diagnosis codes, prescriptions, referrals, test results, and demographic information. These data flows support numerous secondary uses including population health, service planning, and research. Extractors include NHS organisations, as well as large research databases who offer access to collected data for consumers, and companies who may provide analytical services and products built on the data.\n\n\nBirths & deaths\n\nBirths and deaths are reported through established systems of forms and submissions to the level of registration districts. Records here are collated upwards to the General Register Office who hold national records for births and deaths, as well as marriages and civil partnerships. The Office of National Statistics uses this to create the analysis-ready Civil Registrations of Death dataset, that provides patient outcomes that join onto other datasets.\n\n\nNHS Digital submissions\n\nSecondary care data related to patient attendances, diagnoses, and procedures, are largely found within free text in source systems. These are captured through a process of clinical coding, by teams of specialised coders in each hospital, who read through patient records and record the most important information relevant for each episode. This is turned into data tables (e.g. Secondary Uses Service), and submitted to the NHS through a standard system, where data is used both for reimbursements, and for creating analysis datasets (such as the Hospital Episode Statistics). Data for analysis and linkage to other sources are made available through the Data Access Request Service (DARS).\n\n\nNational Disease Registration Service\n\nThe National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) collects data on specific diseases and conditions, primarily cancer and rare diseases. Data is collected in hospitals through a mixture of manual abstraction and coding (typically by cancer audit teams), or by automated extraction from EHR systems (such as chemotherapy prescribing systems or radiology information systems). The resulting datasets include the Cancer Outcomes and Services Dataset (COSD), and the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapies dataset (SACT). Data is used for audit purposes, but also as a research and analytics resource, by being made available through the Data Access Request Service (DARS).\n\n\n\nVersion history\nversion 0.1 24-08-05: first version of key data flows",

    "text": "The NHS hosts some of the most valuable data in the world: a digitised, longitudinal record, across entire care pathways, for an incredibly diverse population. And yet, the question of how to fulfil this value remains an open one. We previously showed that despite high volumes of data flows, there were multiple issues across national data infrastructure:\n\nA large amount of our data remains ‘untapped’, trapped behind proprietary electronic health record systems and archaic document formats. New research infrastructure has often reshuffled the same data that’s been around for decades into new environments;\nThe NHS is not achieving value from its own data. Rather, value (often monetary) is being generated once data had left NHS firewalls;\nThe landscape is both complicated, and opaque.\n\nThat is why we are working with the Tony Blair Institute to comprehensively map NHS data architectures, data sources, and data flows - and to build up a library of information about NHS data. The objective is twofold: to help improve our collective understanding, and to help inform strategic gap analysis.\n\nRoadmap\nHere’s what we want to focus on over the next few months:\n\nAdding detail to the national schematic\nAdding regional architectural schematics, such as SDEs and research environments\nDescribing the different NHS APIs\nDescribing NHS data quality, and fitness for different purposes\nDescribing specific data systems, and characterising their ease of data access\nDescribing laws and processes around information governance, data access, and research approval\n\n\n\nCollaborating\nAs of August 2024, the information hosted on this website are still basic and incomplete.

    "text": "Early preview v0.1\nThis page contains an overview of different types of software systems, or modules within systems, where a patient may have data generated and recorded across their healthcare journey. These are not descriptions of specific software, but rather a general classification based on the different types of data that are generated.\n\nPatient administration\n\nPatient administration systems (PAS)\n\nSoftware that capture non-clinical information about patients, and their activity across different care settings (including all hospitals). Information captured includes identities, demographics, and address, and also captures pathway information such as referrals, waiting lists and appointments, as well as inpatient activity and ward movements or discharge. PAS may be standalone software solutions offered by different suppliers, or may be integrated as a function into Electronic Health Records (EHR) software. PAS also serves as a master patient index for other records in the care location. PAS are joined directly to the national Personal Demographics Service, which is a live, national directory of non-clinical information for patients that is part of the NHS Spine.\n\n\n\nPrimary care\n\nGP software demographic record\n\nMuch like PAS systems, these are parts of a GP Electronic Health Record (EHR) software that maintain a record of non-clinical information for patients, including their GP registration history. Patient details across different GP systems are coordinated through a Primary Care Registration Management service and also synced with the Personal Demographics Service. Data may be accessible to analysts via data tables containing patient identifiers, demographic, address, and registration information.\n\n\nGP software coded clinical record\n\nWhen patients see a clinician, or undergo procedures and tests, or experience medical diagnoses, symptoms, and events, these data are entered into the record as ‘clinical codes’. Coding is performed manually, largely by GPs during or following consultations, or after reviewing letters and results. There are hundreds of thousands of codes that represent unique clinical concepts, and large vocabularies or dictionaries that define these. The most commonly used for primary care in the NHS is SNOMED CT. Codes are typically stored in data tables. A simple example of part of such a table is below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPATIENT_ID\nDATE\nCONCEPT_NAME\nCONCEPT_CODE\n\n\n\n\n123456789\n2020-1-1\nPre-diabetes (disorder)\n858301000000107\n\n\n123456789\n2021-1-1\nDiabetes mellitus type 2 (disorder)\n44054006\n\n\n123456789\n2024-1-1\nRetinopathy due to diabetes mellitus (disorder)\n4855003\n\n\n\n\n\nGP software medication prescriptions\n\nWhen a prescription for a medication is generated, either one off or as a repeat prescription, this information is recorded in the GP EHR. This information is used to send prescriptions to a dispenser (like a local pharmacy), as well as populate the patient’s Summary Care Record with their current medications. The GP EHR also contains records of requests - such as when a patient asks for a prescription to be renewed.\n\n\nGP software laboratory test results\n\nResults from tests and other measurements can be entered into the record by clinicians, and are usually stored as separate tables that also capture result values and outcomes. In many cases, where tests originated in primary care and where there is interoperability between pathology services and the EHR, these values are automatically sent into the system once results are ready.\n\n\nGP software free text clinical record\n\nWhile GPs make effort to code important information about their patients, a large amount of additional information is found in the unstructured, or free text, record. This simply includes blocks of text that are written to describe encounters and other interactions. As part of the medicolegal record, such text typically contains patients’ descriptions of their medical history, symptoms, and other experiences, as well as examination findings and clinical thought processes. Free text data is not readily accessible for analysis, and may also contain idenfitiable information.\n\n\nCommunity pharmacy dispensing\n\nMost prescriptions are dispensed to patients through designated local pharmacies. While the electronic prescription service produces an electronic record of prescribed items that can be used for reimbursements, some prescription and dispensing activity are still conducted through paper based records.\n\n\n\nSecondary / tertiary care\n\nHospital EHR coded clinical record\n\nData that is coded at point of care is less common in secondary care when compared to primary care, but some Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems such as Epic enable the entry of standard codes such as SNOMED CT into a patient’s record. More commonly, data may be “semi-structured” through forms or flowsheets, where records are made with specific fields (such as “medical history”, “recorded symptoms”, and “examination findings”).\n\n\nHospital EHR free text clinical record\n\nThe vast majority of patient data in secondary care is found as free text. This includes narrative that records the details of encounters between clinicians and patients (from admission to ward rounds and discharge), as well as records of procedures and operations, nursing and allied health professional notes, and clinical thought processes (for example from a cancer multi-disciplinary meeting). This also includes discharge summaries, clinical letters, and reports of investigations such as radiology imaging or pathology. These type of data may be in different electronic formats, such as MS Word and pdf files, and often contain valuable information that is not found in the structured record. The traditional way of making this type of data analysable, is through health professionals or clinical coders manually collecting relevant data items, and inputting them into a table. Some of this process is being automated by language artificial intelligence (AI) platforms.\n\n\nHospital EHR lab test results\n\nIn secondary care settings, laboratory test results and other clinical measurements are also captured in data tables. Laboratory results are often managed through dedicated Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) which are part of, or interface with, the main hospital EHR. Data can be used during care for automated alerting of abnormal results, and for viewing trends.\n\n\nHospital patient observations\n\nA rich source of information found only in hospital data, are the frequent physiological measurements that are taken of patients. These may range from measures such as height and weight, to blood pressures, heart rates, temperatures, to real-time recording of vital signs using bedside monitoring. The data may be generated and held in different kinds of system, but most hospital EHRs will allow results to be captured into data tables. In hospitals with intensive care units that have EHR, monitors may output directly into data tables and record detailed trends of vital signs.\n\n\nHospital EHR medications chart / pharmacy systems\n \nHospital pharmacies use electronic systems to manage general medication orders and dispensing, for both inpatient and outpatient care. For inpatients, electronic medication charts are used by clinicians for viewing and recording prescriptions, timings, and administration, often through Electronic Prescription and Medications Administration (EPMA) systems. The data underlying these systems can be used to show what medications and dosages were prescribed, dispensed, and administered. These systems are often part of or interfaced with the main EHR. They may also integrate decision support features for drug interactions and dosing.\n\n\nHospital EHR chemotherapy chart\n\nWhile most medications are prescribed and administered in the general record, specialised chemotherapy systems are often used to administer cytotoxic agents, in both inpatient and outpatient/‘day case’ settings.\n\n\nHospital Radiology / DICOM results\n\nRadiology departments use Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to store and manage medical imaging studies. These systems store images in the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format, along with associated metadata. Radiologists’ reports are typically stored as free text in a Radiology Information System (RIS), which is often integrated with the PACS and the main hospital EHR. DICOM files are typically extremely large. The ability to extract and use DICOMs for analysis relies heavily on being able to access high quality metadata, which can be used to identify and access images of interest.\n\n\nMedical device outputs\n\nNumnerous types of modern medical device, ranging from electrocardiogram machines, to ventilators and infusion pumps, have the capability to output data directly into information systems. Some signals data may be stored in time-series databases (for example - infusion rate every hour). Other device outputs may be stored as scanned images. Many devices do not interface with EHR, or do not have a way to extract data in an analysable form.\n\n\nHistopathology results and reports\n\nDigital pathology systems are increasingly used to capture, store, and analyze high-resolution images of histopathology slides. These systems allow for remote viewing, automated image analysis, and integration with other clinical data sources. The associated pathology reports are often stored as free text within the Laboratory Information System.\n\n\nGenomic testing reports\n\nWhile raw sequencing data is generated in genomics testing labs, these data are not typically available for analysis or clinical use. Instead, reports of gene panels, or reports of specific genetic mutations or biomarkers, are passed to hospitals and stored as free text files (e.g. in .pdf format).\n\n\n\nSpecialist testing\n\n\nMolecular/genomic laboratory network systems\nGenomic testing in the NHS is provided through a national testing network. Specifically, the testing for mutations within tumours (somatic molecular testing) is handled by a network of molecular diagnostic laboratories. The direct results from these tests (e.g. sequencing data) are held locally and not directly available for research or analysis use-cases. However, data are passed back to hospitals as reports.\n\n\n\nVersion history\nversion 0.1 24-08-01: first version of key sources",
